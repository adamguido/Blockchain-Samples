# Blockchain-Samples

Basic Smart Contract Creation:
 Develop a simple smart contract that represents a digital notary. Users can submit documents (or document hashes) to the blockchain to prove the existence of the document at a certain point in time.
Tools: Ethereum, Solidity, Remix IDE.


Token Creation:
Create an ERC-20 or ERC-721 token. An ERC-20 token can be like a new cryptocurrency, while an ERC-721 can represent unique assets (like collectibles).
Tools: Ethereum, Solidity, OpenZeppelin library.

Decentralized Voting System:
Develop a smart contract-based voting system where each participant can vote once, and votes are transparently tallied.
Tools: Ethereum, Solidity, Web3.js for frontend integration.

Simple Decentralized Exchange (DEX):
Create a basic DEX where users can swap between two tokens.
Tools: Ethereum, Solidity, liquidity pool concepts.

Multisig Wallet:
Design a smart contract that acts as a multisignature wallet. Funds can only be withdrawn if a certain number of participants agree (e.g., 2 out of 3 signatures required).
Tools: Ethereum, Solidity.

Loan System with Collateral:
Develop a decentralized loan system where users can lock up tokens as collateral and borrow other tokens. If they donâ€™t repay by a certain time, the collateral can be claimed.
Tools: Ethereum, Solidity, DeFi concepts.

Oracle Implementation:
Create a smart contract that fetches real-world data (like the current weather or a currency exchange rate) and acts upon that data (e.g., release funds if the weather is sunny).
Tools: Ethereum, Solidity, Chainlink for Oracle services.

Layer-2 Scaling Solution:
Integrate a basic Layer-2 scaling solution or sidechain to reduce transaction fees and speed up transactions.
Tools: Ethereum, Solidity, tools like Polygon (Matic) or xDai.
